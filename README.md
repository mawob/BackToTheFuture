# BackToTheFuture

This repository contains files that I created for my
Back-To-The-Future-related projects.
These include laser cutter files and Arduino code for props
for the time machine like the Flux Capacitor, Time Circuits,
Analog Gauges, Speedometer, SID panel, TFC Switch.


Here are links to blog pages for these projects:
