# Sound files for the Flux Capacitor

These sound files are to stored on a 128MB (yes: MB!) micro SD card which is inserted in the DFPlayer Mini as described here:
https://markus-wobisch.blogspot.com/2016/09/arduino-sounds-dfplayer.html

The whole directory and file structure should be preserved and everything should be copied onto the top-level of the microSD card (except for this README.md file which should NOT be copied)
